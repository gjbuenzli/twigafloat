<p>Nothing warms up a space more than some mood lighting. &nbsp; You may have some lights and lanterns in your yard to liven it up a bit at night…why should your boat “yard” be any different.&nbsp; We have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brightech-Ambience-Pro-Waterproof-Outdoor/dp/B075NS8YXG?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=917a2891e0a25d084b72a349a7188f68&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">string lights</a> in the cockpit, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCX2YZNJ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&amp;th=1&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=ab31ec2e2d3c889a2657c68e9b9b8b7f&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">lanterns</a> hanging from the four corners of the boat.</p>



<p>The benefits of these lights are not just aesthetic though.&nbsp; They help supplement our anchor light so that other boats can see us clearly. &nbsp; They also help us to identify our particular boat at anchor when returning from shore at night in the dinghy. &nbsp; Believe me, all boats look pretty much the same in the dark, and having a unique light signature can be extremely helpful.</p>



<p>You’re probably thinking “oh great, one more thing to turn on at night” or “there goes the battery bank”&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; I can read your mind.&nbsp; It’s a creepy but useful skill. &nbsp; Fear not!&nbsp; These lights are solar powered and turn on automatically at dusk.&nbsp; The batteries on them last almost the full night too!</p>
