<p>Chips chips chips.&nbsp; We love chips. &nbsp; When we first got to the Bahamas, we realized that a bag of Doritos was about $7.&nbsp; At first we wished that we had brought more with us, but then we realized that we didn’t have storage for 50 bags of chips.</p>



<p>You know what we did have storage for?&nbsp; A couple <a href="http://&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0098IOL2S?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=a91bc542cca0ee392e2e5e9618fdd761&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">tubs of popcorn</a> kernels and an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01G7DM3G2?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=46d6167892c30efd0df113ffff0c5edb&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">air popper</a>. &nbsp; Now, at least sometimes, we can turn to popcorn when we have the craving for something salty. &nbsp; We also bought a huge multi pack of different <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079S3X9G2?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=e91e555d0fe92217ff94f0446b396fd1&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">seasonings</a> to keep it interesting.&nbsp; The air popper is super easy and safe to use, so the kiddos can make their own without having to fire up the stove (or induction cooktop).</p>



<p>Here’s a pro tip: &nbsp; Air poppers are really healthy because they don’t use oil.&nbsp; Nada.&nbsp; Zip.&nbsp; Zilch.&nbsp; That makes for some pretty dry popcorn.&nbsp; Not only does that lack taste, but the seasoning won’t stick.&nbsp; Instead of dousing it in butter, give yours a quick spray with some coconut oil before adding seasoning.</p>
