<p>People used to have a whole mess of kids to get work done on the farm.&nbsp; The boat is no different, and there are all sorts of great new ways they can lend a helping hand.&nbsp; The great thing is that most of these chores get them involved in the sailing life and more invested in what we’re doing.</p>



<p>Our favorite kid boat chore by far is the “Dinghy Captain”.&nbsp; The DC is responsible for making sure that the dinghy is fully inflated and topped off with gas.&nbsp; If they dinghy is up on the davit, they help bring it down. &nbsp; The also check and make sure the stand up paddle boards (SUPs) are topped off with air.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all that hard work, the dinghy captain has the privilege of getting to drive the dinghy for us that day (check local regulations) if they want.</p>
