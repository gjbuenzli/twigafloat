<p>Yesterday we told you about the Dinghy Captain chore. &nbsp; Our second favorite way to get kids involved (especially the little ones) is to be the “Anchor Pointer”. &nbsp; This one is simple and self explanatory: &nbsp; When we are pulling up the anchor, they stand on the bow and point to where it is.&nbsp; This helps the helmsperson know where to adjust, and lets the person handling the anchor puller upper (windlass) focus.</p>



<p>Bonus:&nbsp; Another great job while weighing anchor is to have a kid be in charge of the freshwater hose (if you have one) to spray mud and saltwater off the chain.&nbsp; This helps extend chain life and keeps the locker clean(er).</p>



<p>There’s no neat little link for you to click on and buy products to support us on this one, so please consider buying us some diesel, or simply signing up for our post notification email to help us out.</p>
