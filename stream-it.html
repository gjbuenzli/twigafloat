<p>If you don’t have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SodaStream-Terra-Sparkling-Water-Bottle/dp/B0B2X132WK?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=2340488e8fcae0eb47c4262fb085c823&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">soda stream</a> on board already, do yourself a favor and go get one right now.&nbsp; If the 3 Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) don’t compel you, the storage space for normal soda cans should. &nbsp; Not to mention the lack of availability of your favorite soda in islands far away.</p>



<p>I will be honest, I wasn’t a believer at first.&nbsp; We had a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SodaStream-Terra-Sparkling-Water-Bottle/dp/B0B2X132WK?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=2340488e8fcae0eb47c4262fb085c823&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">soda stream</a> at home and rarely used it. &nbsp; I’m a Diet Pepsi kind of guy, and you could only get <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS9W68NH?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=092ff573ee247356da2aae742db7fced&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Diet Pepsi syrup</a> in Canda for some reason.&nbsp; We didn’t live in Canada. &nbsp; That all changed about 6 months ago when <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS9W68NH?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=092ff573ee247356da2aae742db7fced&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">DP syrup</a> appeared at a local Target. &nbsp; That broke the seal and made us believers.&nbsp; Now we use it for my soda, soda water, Bubbly (you can buy drops), tonic water, you name it. &nbsp; We have about 5 of the CO2 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sodastream-Exchange-Carbonator-receive-Amazon-com/dp/B082DM585M?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=c14011b5013f9c5de10dca242086fc65&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">refills</a> (we brought 2 and there were 2 on board) which is enough to last us a year.&nbsp; I think we’ll be good.&nbsp; If not, I’ve heard that you can get them refilled in many island destinations.</p>
