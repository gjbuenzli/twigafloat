<p>You have propane stoves, I get it. &nbsp; You don’t need an electric stove.&nbsp; Plus, electric stoves are dangerous and hot.</p>



<p>Sorry to say, but you’re wrong.&nbsp; You need an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Duxtop-8100MC-Portable-Induction-Countertop/dp/B0045QEPYM?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=39c7dc504a9b4c36c4ce61972c04e5eb&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">induction cooktop</a>, and here’s why</p>



<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Sometimes you run out of propane, or the regulator breaks.&nbsp; The latter happened to us, and it took weeks to source a replacement.&nbsp; Our inductive stove saved us</li>



<li>Induction stoves only work on special cookware.&nbsp; That means that you’re not going to get a 300 degree singe when you put your hand on it.&nbsp; Unless your hand is made of stainless steel.</li>



<li>You probably have solar.&nbsp; Or wind generation.&nbsp; Or something like that to keep your electric topped off.&nbsp; Do you have a propane generator?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; The methane from your farts doesn’t count. &nbsp; Inductive stoves are green</li>



<li>You can put a much bigger pan on an induction stove.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-CW102GY-NeverStick-PossiblePan-Integrated/dp/B09SBSD8DM?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=dc49e1ef94d58edbe8c9e99d70e50d7b&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">This is our go to pan</a>, and we can use it for everything because it has high sides.</li>



<li>If the above doesn’t convince you, it’s nice to have another burner.</li>
