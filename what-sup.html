<p>Stand up paddle boards blasted on the scene about 15 years ago.&nbsp; Now, it seems that every boat has at least one.&nbsp; But this hack isn’t about that….</p>



<p>Here’s the secret:&nbsp; have you noticed that your dinghy uses the same adapter as your SUP?&nbsp; At least ours does. &nbsp; That means that we can keep a single SUP pump in our dinghy that serves as our dinghy pump and our SUP pump.&nbsp; No need to have an extra foot pump for your dinghy!&nbsp; Oh, and if you have multiple SUPs (we have 3), you have backups (if you have the space to store them).</p>
