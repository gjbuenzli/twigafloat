<p>Reduce, reuse, recycle.&nbsp; RRR.&nbsp; We’ve all heard about the three R’s.&nbsp; I personally hear the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSM2riAEX4U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Jack Johnson song</a> every time the subject comes up.&nbsp; And come up it does.&nbsp; All the time.&nbsp; On land, we were being good citizens of the planet by invoking the 3Rs, but on a boat, it’s a way of life.&nbsp; You simple don’t have space to store a bunch of consumables, and you don’t have much room to store them when they become trash.</p>



<p>One of the biggest offenders are Paper Towels.&nbsp; I hear it all the time when we meet new cruising families.&nbsp; “Where do you store all the paper towels?”.&nbsp; “The hardest part of the Bahamas/Virgin Islands/Kokomo is finding paper towels at the store”.</p>



<p>My response?&nbsp; We don’t.&nbsp; Well, sort of.&nbsp; We have a few rolls of paper towels for bacon grease, engine oil, etc…but mostly we use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reusable-Washable-Absorbent-Friendly-Cardboard/dp/B0B47PSQZW?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=7a84d6b3cfe02c5db1cd4d6a681ae0a8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">cloth paper towels</a>. &nbsp; These are small, washable, and can be rolled up just like your mom’s paper towels.</p>
