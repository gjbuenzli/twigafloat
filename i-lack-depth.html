<p class="">Nothing is worse than realizing that you lack depth. &nbsp; Especially when you have your life savings invested in a sailboat that you’re living on with your family, and your depth sounder suddenly stops working.&nbsp; Even worse is if you’re in an area that the charts mark as “shoals”. &nbsp; “Shoals” is shorthand for:&nbsp; the sand on the bottom in these parts moves around a lot, so we can’t tell you what the depth is at any given moment.&nbsp; Have a nice day!</p>



<p class="">That’s why you have a depth sounder.&nbsp; Ours in particular has been wiley at best. &nbsp; When we first moved aboard, we realized that it wasn't logging the boat speed.&nbsp; Most do.&nbsp; Ours doesn’t.&nbsp; It’s not broken, it’s just not a feature.&nbsp; We learned to live with that, and got our boat speed from other sources. &nbsp; It also, when working, reports the depth 2 feet shallower than it actually is.&nbsp; How did we figure that out?&nbsp; Easy, our first day on board we hit ground when the gauge said 2.5 feet.&nbsp; Our boat is 4.5 feet deep, so that must mean a 2 ft offset that we need to calculate on the fly.&nbsp; Or, we could calibrate it.&nbsp; It’s on the list.</p>



<p class="">Bottom growth (little nasties growing on the bottom of the boat) also affects the depth sounder, requiring regular cleaning.&nbsp; Failure to do this results in some erratic results. &nbsp; That is super fun when you’re trying to anchor and it tells you that the water is thirty feet deep when it’s ten. &nbsp; Or it says twenty and you’re hitting bottom.&nbsp; Both have happened.&nbsp; Why is it important to know the depth when anchoring?&nbsp; Well, not only do you not want to hit the bottom (obvious), but you need to know the depth to decide how much chain to put out.&nbsp; That keeps you from dragging anchor, which in turn keeps your boat from crashing ashore and being pounded to little bits in the surf.</p>



<p class="">All of the above items are just everyday fun that every boater deals with, but this time it just stopped working.&nbsp; Instead of showing us numbers for the depth, it constantly displayed “--”.&nbsp; Not ideal. &nbsp; I immediately ordered a new depth sounder on Amazon, to be delivered the day before we were scheduled to head out on an overnight passage.&nbsp; I could just swap it out really quick once it arrived and we’d be good to go.&nbsp; Then, of course, the package got delayed.&nbsp; It was now set to deliver the night before we left.&nbsp; That’s cutting it close.&nbsp; But, luckily, it was delivered at 9pm as promised.&nbsp; Hurray!&nbsp; Except that the marina office was closed at 9, and we had no idea where in the complex it actually got dropped off.</p>



<p class="">No worries, luckily Hunter ended up in the ER, so we didn’t have to leave the next day.&nbsp; Did I just say that?&nbsp; I by no means mean that it was lucky that he was in the ER.&nbsp; It was lucky that we didn’t have to leave, because it took all day for them to track down the package. &nbsp; When I finally got my cherished brown smiling box, I was ready to open it up and get installing. &nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; This doesn’t look right.&nbsp; Where’s the sensor?&nbsp; Whoops…they forgot to include it.&nbsp; After a pretty quick interchange with Amazon Customer service, a new one was on the way…and it would be here in three days.&nbsp; Looks like we’re going to be waiting at the marina for a while waiting for the new new depth sounder.</p>



<p class="">“New”.&nbsp; That word should have tipped me off.&nbsp; They change the standard way of building boats every year, and most builders don’t follow any standard.&nbsp; That means that the older your boat is, the less likely that off the shelf parts are going to just work. &nbsp; This is nowhere more true than with boat electronics.&nbsp; Depth sounders are electronics. &nbsp; What’s worse is that they are electronics that plug into other electronics.</p>



<p class="">When the right unit finally arrived, I realized quickly that I was about to try to fit a square hole into a round peg.&nbsp; The sounder was top of the line, which meant that it didn’t plug into our 5 year old chart plotter that had been adapted to work on our 15 year old boat.&nbsp; I hadn’t ordered the adapter. &nbsp; I tried for hours to unplug and move around various components behind the chart plotter to get an open port to plug into.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; What’s worse was that I had to take down the kitchen cabinets to get to the back of the plotter.</p>



<p class="">This wasn’t even supposed to be the hard part.&nbsp; This was just testing the wiring.&nbsp; I still had to take the old depth sounder out and install the new one into the boat.&nbsp; No biggie, right?&nbsp; Wrong.&nbsp; Depth sounders get installed into thru hulls, which are exactly what the name suggests.&nbsp; They are a big 2 inch wide hole through the hull of your boat. &nbsp; You would ideally swap out something in a thru hull while out of the water so that you don’t sink the boat.&nbsp; We don’t live in the ideal world, so I was going to try a trick that our instructor captains showed me.</p>



<p class="">Step 1:&nbsp; get a big thru hull plug and a large mallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="">Step 2:&nbsp; start to unscrew the old depth sounder, with somebody standing by with the mallet and plug</p>



<p class="">Step 3:&nbsp; As soon as the piece is free and a spout of water starts rushing into the boat, jam the plug in the hole and start pounding with the mallet.</p>



<p class="">Step 4:&nbsp; Take a deep breath, and then do the steps in reverse with the new depth sounder.&nbsp; Hoping the whole time that they didn’t change the size in the last 15 years, which they probably did, making the whole exercise moot.</p>



<p class="">I was not looking forward to this.</p>



<p class="">Oh well, back to the wiring. &nbsp; Google was no help.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because there just happened to not have been anybody who recently tried to port an Airmar 810 into a C470 Fishfinder that interfaces with a Raymarine eS series via NMEA 2000 adapted to RayTalk.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; Looks like I have to try to piece together a solution from bits of various posts.</p>



<p class="">One in particular caught my eye.&nbsp; Did you try to reset the sonar? &nbsp; Um, no.&nbsp; You can reset the sonar?&nbsp; Is that the same as the depth sounder?&nbsp; Yes you can.&nbsp; Yes it is. &nbsp; Of course there are no instructions on how to do this, so I start fiddling with the various settings on the chart plotter.&nbsp; Eventually I found something that looked close, and took a shot.&nbsp; I had to select my depth sounder type from a drop down list.&nbsp; Not knowing what the old one was exactly, I picked the most interesting sounding name from the list and held my breath.</p>



<p class="">The result? &nbsp; After being without depth for weeks.&nbsp; After waiting for the new depth sounder to arrive from Amazon (twice).&nbsp; After spending a day scratching my head trying to figure out the electrical connection and fretting the thru hull.&nbsp; After Mere had to take the kids for a walk so that they wouldn’t hear my cussing.&nbsp; After all of that…the solution was basically that I needed to reboot and the depth sounder magically started working again.</p>



<p class="">Sigh.&nbsp; At least I got my money back from Amazon.</p>
