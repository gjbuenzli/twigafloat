<p>The sheer amount of information that we have to learn just to get to the point that we know what we need to learn in mind bendingly daunting.</p>



<p>The books are great. Weather. Engines. Watermakers. Electrical systems. Sailing.</p>



<p>yada. yada. yada. of course.</p>



<p>well, I've got news for you buddy….none of those books tell you about the Christmas winds.</p>



<p>Why would they? Christmas winds are specific to a part of the Caribbean, during a specific time of year.</p>



<p>For example, did you know that they are specific to the exact location where our boat needs to sail to get from Panama to ECUSA (East Cost USA)?</p>



<p>Also, did you know they kick in during mid December (aka "Christmas") and last through the winter?</p>



<p>Also, did you know that they are super gusty and harsh?</p>



<p>Also, did you know that Mid January is when we're delivering our boat?</p>



<p>Also, did you know that those trivial little steel cables called "standing rigging" that hold up the mast (that big pole in the middle with the big sail on it… and a bunch of expensive electronics like the radar) should be replaced every 10 years.</p>



<p>Also, did you know that ours is 15 yrs old.</p>



<p>Looks like we'll be checking in withe the Captain quite a lot while they deliver. I guess if we can't reach them…we start to worry?</p>



<p>Sigh, Christmas (winds) Blows.</p>
