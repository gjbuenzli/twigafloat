<p>The ginger ale is in the boy’s bathroom.&nbsp; I don’t know how many times that we’ve heard that strange statement on Twig.&nbsp; You see, we live on a catamaran that was first put in service as a charter boat.&nbsp; Charter boats cater to four couples splitting the bill on a weekly cat rental, and therefore have one head (bathroom) per couple.</p>



<p>That’s great for charterers, but there’s no way that more than one person at a time out of our family of five is going to shower at once.&nbsp; The water pump just won’t keep up. &nbsp; We don’t need intidivdual showers if we’re not showering at the same time.&nbsp; That means we have three extra showers on our boat.&nbsp; What we don’t have is a ton of storage space.</p>



<p>So what did we do?&nbsp; We converted two of the showers to storage by building shelves into them. &nbsp; One head became the laundry room (we have a small washer/dryer) and the other is our beverage storage/boys bathroom. &nbsp; It has been a lifesaver for storage.</p>



<p>The 4th shower is in Mom and Dad’s head.&nbsp; We don’t use it right now, but have it in reserve.&nbsp; Often, this is where you can find gallon jugs of Vinegar.</p>
