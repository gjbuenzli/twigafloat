<p class="">Today I wet the bed.&nbsp; The worst part is that it wasn't the first time.&nbsp; The last time was a few months ago in the Bahamas while we were running away from a nasty squall. &nbsp; That time was really embarrassing, because I wet the boys' bed, not my own.&nbsp; When you share a small bed in tight quarters, it’s particularly shameful when it’s been wet.</p>



<p class="">It’s not my fault.&nbsp; Once you break the seal, there’s no stopping it.&nbsp; We may need to resort to covering the bed with plastic sheets. &nbsp; Actually, this morning was my fault.&nbsp; I had my hose out and it was spraying everywhere. &nbsp; I wasn’t even in the bed when I wet it, but I still got it with the stream.</p>



<p class="">You see, water is constantly trying to get into the boat.&nbsp; We do a pretty good job of keeping it out, but sometimes we forget a window/hatch. &nbsp; Back at home, if you forgot to close a window before a storm, the floor might get a little wet.&nbsp; On the boat, the window is like a sunroof and is directly over the bed.&nbsp; Forget to close that, and a wave or rain will undoubtedly find its way onto your bed.</p>



<p class=""><br>This morning I was spraying off the solar panels.&nbsp; They had acquired a salty sheen and needed a good hosing. &nbsp; It didn’t even occur to me to check the hatch…which was open. &nbsp; Whoops. &nbsp; Ditto for when I wet the boys' bed.&nbsp; Their hatch was open when we had to go underway at a moment's notice.&nbsp; A squall had come in, putting us on a lee shore.&nbsp; That means that the big nasty wind and rain are blowing you right toward the shore.&nbsp; If your anchor drags, you end up on the rocks.&nbsp; Rocks bad.&nbsp; We hastily made way and forgot to close their hatch, soaking their beds.<br>We’ve tried to keep “going underway” lists, but there are just so many things to remember.&nbsp; It would take up a whole journal.&nbsp; I guess we’ll just keep trying our best, and I’ll try not to wet the bed <s>anymore</s> often.</p>
