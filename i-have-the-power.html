<p>Don't let the title fool you, this hack is not about He Man.  How much power do we have left? &nbsp; This is a question that is heard on most sailboats multiple times per day. &nbsp; We have a huge bank on our boat, but still seem to never have enough juice. &nbsp; In addition to conservation, we like to keep extra power in reserve.</p>



<p>You’re probably familiar with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Ultra-Compact-High-Speed-VoltageBoost-Technology/dp/B07QXV6N1B?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=8e15268de1b4d2f589356aaeb4a3355e&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">battery banks</a> that you can use to quickly charge your devices without plugging into the main power.&nbsp; If you don’t have one, you should get one.&nbsp; Or four.</p>



<p>But, are you familiar with how far rechargeable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00JHKSN76?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=08524093cff2b3c35413a5dda5e35b87&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">AA</a>/<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-BK-4MCCA4BA-eneloop-Pre-Charged-Rechargeable/dp/B00JHKSMJK?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=057986c417e006109a0185e6ef3bfad9&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">AAA</a> batteries have advanced? &nbsp; Our favorite is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-K-KJ17MC124A-eneloop-Adapters-Individual/dp/B00JHKSLLY?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=70b62f1d54f43b5a2e0cafaa5644b19b&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Eneloop by panasonic</a>.&nbsp; We’ve heard that you should avoid putting them in VHF handhelds, but we put them in all of our other devices that require <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00JHKSN76?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=08524093cff2b3c35413a5dda5e35b87&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">AA</a>/<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-BK-4MCCA4BA-eneloop-Pre-Charged-Rechargeable/dp/B00JHKSMJK?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=057986c417e006109a0185e6ef3bfad9&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">AAA</a> batteries.&nbsp; When drained, you just charge them back up and go on your merry way. &nbsp; No batteries in the landfill, nor storing tons of spare batteries, no expense of buying over and over.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What about C and D cells?&nbsp; They make <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eneloop-Spacers-Ni-MH-Rechargeable-Battery/dp/B00WF0V3YU?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=104767bc2132f4ffde29a41f042af035&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">adapters</a>.&nbsp; You just stick a AA in there and you're off to the races. &nbsp; They don’t last as long as a full D or C…but I’m willing to accept that tradeoff.</p>



<p>Honestly, whether you're on a boat or on land, you should get these.&nbsp; I think they should be standard issue for everybody who has a kid.</p>
