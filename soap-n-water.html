<p>Chances are that you either have a sink full of sudsy water in your galley, or you have to store dish soap by the gallon because you go through it so often.</p>



<p>Here’s a secret:  get a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Refillable-Containers-Adjustable-Gardening-Aromatherapy/dp/B08TX143D9?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=5bb4c170bbd851b543c90d431b4bd822&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">spray bottle</a> and fill it up with mostly water.  Shoot a bit of dish soap in there and shake it up.   The exact amount is up to you.  Next time you do the dishes, spray that on the dishes instead of a full squirt of soap.  It’s mostly water, so you don’t have to run your sink.  It has a bit of soap, so you’re getting the dish clean.   Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>



<p>Pro tip:&nbsp; this same method is used to create the sudsy foaming soap that you may use.&nbsp; Instead of buying a refill of “foaming soap”, you can use (cheaper) regular hand soap and water (50/50) mix.</p>
