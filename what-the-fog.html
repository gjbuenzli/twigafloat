<p class="">I went down to take a quick she-she (that’s Hawaiian for pee-pee) and left Jade at the helm.&nbsp; When I came up I remember thinking “hmm, that’s funny, visibility is pretty poor.&nbsp; Was it like that when I went downstairs?”.&nbsp; It probably was, I just hadn’t noticed the haze slowly creeping in on us. &nbsp; Within five minutes, we couldn’t see more than 200 feet in front of us.</p>



<p class="">There are all sorts of rules on what you’re supposed to do when you find yourself in fog.&nbsp; I remember studying them for the sailing certifications exams way back when.&nbsp; I also remember thinking “I’m purging this from my brain.&nbsp; No way I’m ever going to find myself in fog in the Bahamas”. That just goes to show you how little we know about weather.</p>



<p class="">I can handle this.&nbsp; No need to bother Meredith, who was downstairs catching up on a few winks after a rolly night at anchor.&nbsp; She and Jade don’t sleep well when there are waves.&nbsp; Something that I wish we knew before buying a boat. &nbsp; Anyway, she was asleep, and I can handle a little fog.</p>



<p class="">What did the book say? &nbsp; Slow down.&nbsp; Ok, done.&nbsp; We were screaming along at 8.3 knots (about 10 MPH), and I pulled back the engines so that we were going about 6. &nbsp; Listen.&nbsp; Ok, no problem, I turned off the music. &nbsp; Should be all good now, right?</p>



<p class="">The kids were downstairs doing school, so I didn’t want to bother them.&nbsp; When Jade came up for a breather, I put her on the starboard (right) side of the boat to watch out for other boats that I couldn’t see around the jib (the sail up front).&nbsp; Did I mention that I left the sail up?&nbsp; Idiot.</p>



<p class="">All was well for awhile, and&nbsp; I kept thinking that I’d wake up Mere if things didn’t clear up in about 10 more minutes.&nbsp; &nbsp; Eventually, she woke up on her own and came upstairs to the scene. &nbsp; What had unfolded slowly for me was in stark contrast to what had been the reality when she laid down.&nbsp; We had almost no visibility.&nbsp; The sail was up.&nbsp; We were still going pretty fast (6 knots) for a sailboat in fog. &nbsp; I had a kid peeking around corners to look for possible collisions.</p>



<p class="">It was, at about that exact moment, that we saw the other sailboat. &nbsp; It was gliding through the fog about one hundred feet in front of us. &nbsp; We could barely see its ghostly shape through the mist as it crossed perpendicular to us, and it was obvious that they couldn’t see us.&nbsp; No lights.&nbsp; No fog horn.&nbsp; No calls on the VHF.&nbsp; Nada.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="">Just like us.</p>



<p class="">That woke us out of our lull quickly. &nbsp; First we took down the sail and got our full 360 degrees of visibility back.&nbsp; The nav lights came on to make it easier for others to spot us, and to know which way we were moving.&nbsp; We slowed down to a crawl.&nbsp; The radar was switched on.</p>



<p class="">As we made our way slowly along, we pondered “sounding off”. &nbsp; You are required to blow your horn at a set interval in fog, so that others can hear you if they don’t see you. &nbsp; Our “horn” is one of those handheld air horns that people sneak into football games…but marine grade.&nbsp; We pulled it out and Jade was instantly curious.&nbsp; “What’s that?”.&nbsp; I guess we didn’t do a great job showing her all the safety equipment on the boat. &nbsp; “That’s our horn Jade.&nbsp; Wanna hear it?”.&nbsp; I depressed the button without waiting for a response.&nbsp; Inside the enclosed helm.&nbsp; About two feet from both of our ears.&nbsp; Whoops.&nbsp; It looks like we’re both going to operate with one ear for a bit.</p>



<p class="">The fog didn’t lift for quite some time.&nbsp; We had the whole family on deck looking in various directions for other boats. &nbsp; It took an hour or so to start to break up, which is about the time we saw the second boat.&nbsp; This time the radar caught it, and it was heading right toward us, and into the fog.&nbsp; We dutifully turned ten degrees away from them, and they passed safely into the fog bank as we glided out of it.</p>



<p class="">As we cranked our engines back up, we pondered how lucky we were to escape unharmed. &nbsp; Luck really does favor the prepared, and we were not prepared. &nbsp; Hopefully the other boat that we saw with no lights or horn also made it out ok.&nbsp; Fog can happen pretty much anywhere, and just because all of the postcards show sunshine doesn’t mean the islands are immune.&nbsp; If you’re out on a boat, please review what you're supposed to do in fog, and make sure that you are ready.&nbsp;</p>
