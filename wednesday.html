<p class="">This post is somewhat of a letter to my future self.&nbsp; A reminder of those sweet moments during our time off that I can wrap myself in once we are back to our busy lives.&nbsp; I know that I get in a funk and focus on a lot of the things that are not quite as we expected living on a boat.&nbsp; It’s not all like that.&nbsp; A lot of our life is exactly as we had hoped it would be.&nbsp; Yesterday was a day like that.</p>



<p class="">It’s not that there weren’t boat projects, there are (were?).&nbsp; The shower in the back of the boat developed a leak, keeping the deck perpetually soaked.&nbsp; I couldn’t fix it because I was waiting for parts.&nbsp; The parts were delivered two days ago, but nobody could seem to find them (they eventually emerged in the evening, so I’ll fix it today).&nbsp; Plus, this marina has a “no maintenance” policy that I’m milking to give me a little time off.</p>



<p class="">Also, Hunter is sick.&nbsp; A bad case of strep put him in the ER a couple of days ago, so we’re taking a breather from activities so he can rest.</p>



<p class="">So what was so great about yesterday?&nbsp; Well, Jade wanted to make apple cider donuts.&nbsp; Of the recipes that she found, they all needed either cream of tartar or nutmeg, neither of which we had on the boat.&nbsp; So, I walked to the store with Zulu to get some.&nbsp; The store is two miles away, so we were able to get in a nice bit of exercise on a really pleasant (60 degrees) afternoon.&nbsp; When I got back, everybody was just chillin’, so I did the same thing.&nbsp; I grabbed a book, and sat in the cockpit and read for a couple of hours.</p>



<p class="">At about 5, Meredith and I had some cocktails and watched the tourists boarding the boat behind us for a sunset cruise.&nbsp; Greyson grabbed his scooter and rode up and down the dock while the sky lit up with color.&nbsp; I cuddled with Hunter, who is still recovering and weak.</p>



<p class="">As the evening closed in, Greyson and Jade started cooking us dinner. &nbsp; They made a warming chicken pot pie for us to all enjoy together while watching a movie as a family.</p>



<p class="">It was beautiful.&nbsp; But, I haven’t told you the best part. &nbsp; It was a Wednesday.&nbsp; While the rest of the world was scurrying to and from meetings and other appointments, I was taking a long walk and reading a book. &nbsp; Taking time off from our busy lives to just be together as a family has allowed us to bond as a family in ways I never imagined.&nbsp; It also gives us extra moments to just relax and be with ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="">If you get the chance, take the time off.&nbsp; Whether it’s a normal vacation, or a drawn out sabbatical, take the time to separate yourself from an agenda.&nbsp; Relax and enjoy the moment.</p>
