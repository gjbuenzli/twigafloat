<p>Usually when I go on a walk with our dog Zulu, people pass by without a glance. Maybe a couple half hearted "good morning"s. But, today was different. For some reason everybody I saw smiled at me.</p>



<p>Maybe they think I'm cute? Sure, if you're into overweight middle age men with a receeding hairline.</p>



<p>Maybe my fly is down? Nope, all systems go.</p>



<p>It's probably the dog. She is adorable. Even with that long hanger of drool coming out of her mouth.</p>



<p>Then it dawned on me.</p>



<p>I'M SMILING!</p>

<p>It turns out, when you smile, people have a tendancy to smile back.</p>

<p>Duh.</p>



<p>Well, no, not duh. Not to me. You see, I suffer from a severe case of RBF. Despite the best efforts of doctors, psychiatrists, and comedians, my default resting face is somewhat of a frown. When I think I'm smiling, it's actually more of a straight face. A true smile is so rare that it actually aches my face muscles.</p>



<p>But not today, today my face is beaming and I can't stop it.</p>



<p>You see, today we went under contract on a beautiful Lagoon 450F that is currently bobbing along in Fort Lauderdale.</p>



<p>After months of looking at every catamaran between 40 and 50 feet on the market, we finally found our dream boat! It has everything we need (almost: we have to add A/C): solar, lithium, 4 cabins, flybridge, forward cockpit. It's lovely!</p>



<p>It turns out that the cure to RBF is to have a mid life crisis, spend your savings on a boat, move aboard with your family, and see the world.</p>



<p>Maybe I redefined RBF as a new state of "resting boat face"?</p>
