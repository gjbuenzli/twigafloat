<p>You will get wet.&nbsp; You’ll get wet early, you’ll get wet often.&nbsp; You’ll get wet in the shower, and you’ll get wet while sleeping (rain).&nbsp; Towels, however, are huge and bulky and hard to store.</p>



<p>Wrong! &nbsp; I present to you the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GLAMBURG-Peshtemal-Turkish-Oversized-Absorbent/dp/B07PPHYX2Q?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=88f028b79e4c79f9de46340c111622eb&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Turkish Towel</a>.&nbsp; These beauties are lightweight, dry quickly, and get the job done.&nbsp; We have no problem storing enough for a family of five in a small cabinet. &nbsp; There are some really expensive designer ones out there if that’s your jam, but we go with the inexpensive ones above.&nbsp; You can get them at Costco too.</p>
