<p>It’s amazing what a movie under the stars will do for morale on a boat.&nbsp; As long as you’ve kept the bugs in check with a <a href="https://twigafloat.com/buzz-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thermacell</a>, the whole crew can rally around the drive- in atmosphere of an outdoor movie.</p>



<p>Well, duh.&nbsp; Of course everybody would enjoy that.&nbsp; But it sounds expensive.&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp; You can pick up an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TMY-Projector-Supported-Projection-Compatible/dp/B082F13J55?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=9884249a93c56cab8c5990de22e34e5b&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">inexpensive projector</a> to get the job done.&nbsp; The linked projector even includes a movie screen to use, but you can also just use a white sheet.&nbsp; I’ve even heard of cruising families using the projector on their sail to watch a movie underway at night.&nbsp; Cool.</p>



<p>Time to fire up your <a href="https://twigafloat.com/pop-it-like-its-hot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">popcorn popper</a> and have family movie night!</p>



<p>Full disclosure:&nbsp; our projector came on our boat.&nbsp; It’s a few generations old, so I couldn’t find it on Amazon.&nbsp; We don’t have the exact projector listed above, but it looks good and is only $65.<br>You’re welcome.&nbsp; Please check out our<a href="https://www.twigafloat.com/cruising-hacks"> other hacks</a>, and sign up to receive updates when we publish a new one!</p>
