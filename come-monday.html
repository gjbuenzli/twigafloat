<p>My daughter can cry at will.&nbsp; It’s a useful skill for a pre-teen, but I haven’t found an occasion to try to use it myself.&nbsp; Until today.&nbsp; Today, one of my heroes died, and I was shocked to find that I wasn’t as sad as I thought that I would be. &nbsp; I thought I’d try the crying at will thing, but came up dry.&nbsp; I didn’t understand.&nbsp; Am I a monster? I searched my soul for the reason, and came up with what I think sums it up:&nbsp; I’m so overwhelmed with gratitude for the influence that Jimmy Buffett has had on my life, that I have little room left to mourn.</p>



<p>If you have asked me why we quit our jobs, bought a boat, and sailed off into the sunset, you’ve probably gotten one of two responses:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first response is longer winded:&nbsp; I first heard Buffett when I was in high school 30 years ago. &nbsp; Since that day, I’ve been obsessed with the lifestyle, and the idea of buying a boat.&nbsp; That translated into a three decade scheme to get “out there”. &nbsp; When my wife and I started dating, I made sure that she was onboard with getting on board before we got too serious. &nbsp; We got married, and kept planning.&nbsp; The date kept pushing back until one day we decided to just bite the bullet and buy a boat.</p>



<p>The second response is more succinct:&nbsp; If you listen to Jimmy Buffett long enough, eventually you buy a boat.</p>



<p>More simply stated, I bought a boat because Jimmy Buffett made me do it.</p>



<p>The music of Buffett has set me on this path, and kept me there.&nbsp; The true seed happened when I listened to an interview he gave about the time period when he first started making it big.&nbsp; He reminisced that he didn’t know how long the fame train was going to run, so he used the first big paycheck to buy a sailboat.&nbsp; If it all turned south tomorrow, he reasoned, he could always sail off on his boat.</p>



<p>There was something tremendously freeing about that attitude.&nbsp; It’s not a shirking of responsibility or a demonization of working hard.&nbsp; It’s a recognition that you gotta take life a little less seriously and that there are beautiful, simple things out there that you can always turn to.</p>



<p>So, on the day after the passing of Jimmy Buffett, I find myself in gratitude for the attitude and lifestyle that he taught the world about through song. &nbsp; It’s that attitude that convinced us to move to Hawaii when we first got married.&nbsp; It’s that spirit that led us to jump off a boathouse as part of our wedding ceremony.&nbsp; It’s that promise of “a better way” that got us to move onto a boat and sail off with the family.</p>



<p>Here’s to you Bubba, and thanks for being my guide. &nbsp; You left us too young, but had a great run.</p>



<p>Crap.&nbsp; Never mind.&nbsp; Now I am crying.</p>
