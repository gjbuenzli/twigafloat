<p>You love coffee.&nbsp; You know you do.&nbsp; I haven’t met a cruiser yet who doesn’t.&nbsp; It gets you through night watches and early morning departures.&nbsp; Plus, it’s just delicious.</p>



<p>But, your land based glass carafe isn’t going to cut it on the boat.&nbsp; First, glass breaks.&nbsp; Glass and boats are a bad combo.&nbsp; Second, glass carafe coffee makers keep your brew warm by means of a hot plate.&nbsp; That not only scalds your future cups, but it uses a ton of electricity all morning.&nbsp; Using a ton of electricity is a no-no on just about any boat.</p>



<p>Do yourself a favor and pick up a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N6T5QNO?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=eb4362249a2575efa1a510a6453dd3bf&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">thermal carafe coffee maker</a>.&nbsp; It will only use electricity during the brew cycle, and it keeps it warm without scalding.</p>



<p>Also, if you’re super cheap, you can make tomorrow’s coffee on top of today’s leftovers.&nbsp; The coffee stays pretty protected from the elements in the carafe, so it stays good.&nbsp; Up to you.&nbsp; I personally do it when I’m rationing my grounds because I can’t find Dunkin anywhere.</p>
