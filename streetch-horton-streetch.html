<p>Ropes and fancy knots are the go to solution of the ages for sailors needing to tie down just about anything.&nbsp; That’s all well and good, but sometimes we’re looking for something quick and easy and we don’t want to hunt down a 5ft piece of rope.</p>



<p>That’s why we keep a ton of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kotap-Adjustable-Bungee-10-Piece-Assortment/dp/B00UW5BP70?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=12dbf0bf978cfb01a6db69bcacfeb2d9&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">bungees</a> around. &nbsp; We have dozens.&nbsp; We hold down SUPs, we hold up curtains, we keep our scuba tanks from rattling.&nbsp; This list goes on and on. &nbsp; Even better, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kotap-Adjustable-Bungee-10-Piece-Assortment/dp/B00UW5BP70?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=twigafloat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=12dbf0bf978cfb01a6db69bcacfeb2d9&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">these bungees</a> are plastic coated (no rust yet) and the length can adjust (and re-adjust) to suit your immediate need.&nbsp; I highly recommend picking some up.</p>
